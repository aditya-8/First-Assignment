1. WHAT ARE YOUR MOTIVATIONS TOWARDS BIOINFORMATICS?
I AM INTERESTED IN CANCER BIOLOGY AND DRUG DISCOVERY. THESE TWO FIELDS ARE DEPENDENT ON BIOINFORMATICS AND ONE NEEDS TO DO 
SEVERAL COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES. SO, I WANT TO EXPERTISE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND EXPLORE ITS AVENUES.








2. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO GAIN FROM THIS ASSOCIATION?

 FROM THIS ASSOCIATION, I WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN AND FOSTER KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BIOINFORMATICS. BY BEING A MEMBER OF THIS 
 ASSOCIATION, I CAN DEVELOP GOOD PROGRAMMING AND CODING SKILLS,PRESENTATION AND CONFIDENCE IN ME. ALSO, I WILL GET TO 
 INTERACT WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY ASSOCIATION AND GET IDEAS ABOUT THE METHODS INVOLVED IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY.
  I FEEL THIS ASSOCIATION PROMOTES SOMETHING KNOWN AS SHARING OF KNOWLEDGE, WHICH MEANS WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR COLLEAGUES
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY SHARE WHATEVER INFORMATION WE HAVE COLLECTED  OR KNOWN TO US WITH OTHERS.
